# My Missionary Work
A web app for tracking and coordinating missionary work within a ward

## Description
My Missioanry Work is a web application built for the purpose of coordinating missionary work between organizations within a ward. At the core of the app are families, called households. Each household record contains the contact and demographic information for each family member. Households are generally less active members or investigators of the church who may not have a church record. Aside from storing and organizing basic contact information this app also allows organizations within the church to track their interactions with a household. Visit records attached to a household create a history that can be used to the track progress of households and individuals and help organizations coordinate future visits.

## Tech Specs
My Missionary Work is built on top of the Laravel and Vue frameworks. It's initial design is for mobile devices. The home screen by default lists households by who was visited most recently. Filters allow the user to view visits for a specific organization or find those households who haven't been visited recently. Clicking on a household shows the contact info for the household and a history of visits.
